# GZDoom Netcode Modernization Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed changes to modernize GZDoom's netcode, incorporating concepts from QuakeWorld to create a client-server model with improved network performance and reliability.

## Current State

GZDoom currently uses a peer-to-peer model designed for IPX and modem play, which is deterministic but not optimized for modern internet connections.

## Goals

1. Implement a client-server model
2. Improve network performance and reduce latency
3. Enhance reliability and reduce desyncs
4. Maintain compatibility with existing GZDoom features
5. Provide robust support for modding in multiplayer environments

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Network Architecture

- Converted from peer-to-peer to client-server model
- Implemented server authority for game state
- Created separate client and server logic

### 2. Protocol Updates

- Developed a new network protocol based on QuakeWorld concepts
- Implemented reliable and unreliable message channels
- Added support for delta compression of game state updates

### 3. Client Prediction and Interpolation

- Implemented client-side prediction for player movement
- Added entity interpolation for smooth movement of other players and objects

### 4. Server-side Changes

- Implemented authoritative server-side physics
- Added support for running as a dedicated server
- Implemented more frequent, smaller state updates

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- Implemented Huffman coding for general data compression
- Added delta compression for game state updates

### 6. Modding Support

- Implemented ACS and ZScript network bridges for mod synchronization
- Created mod synchronization system for multiplayer sessions

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Integration and Testing

- Integrate new netcode with existing GZDoom codebase
- Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Implement and test simple networked game state

### 2. Additional Components

- Implement network diagnostics tools
- Develop mod compatibility checking system
- Create user-friendly networking API for modders

### 3. Further Optimizations

- Implement adaptive network update rates
- Add bandwidth estimation and throttling
- Further optimize network message packaging and compression

### 4. Compatibility

- Ensure new netcode works with all existing GZDoom features
- Implement and test fallback mode for legacy networking

### 5. Documentation and Final Testing

- Create comprehensive documentation for developers, server operators, and mod creators
- Conduct thorough testing in various network conditions and with complex mods

## Implementation Strategy

1. Complete integration of new netcode with existing GZDoom systems
2. Implement remaining components (diagnostics, mod compatibility, modding API)
3. Optimize and refine implemented features
4. Ensure full compatibility with existing features and mods
5. Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
6. Create detailed documentation

## Next Steps

1. Complete integration of new netcode with main GZDoom codebase
2. Implement remaining components (diagnostics, mod compatibility, modding API)
3. Optimize and refine implemented features
4. Ensure full compatibility with existing features and mods
5. Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
6. Create detailed documentation

## Immediate Tasks

1. Implement integration tests for client-server communication
2. Develop system tests for full gameplay scenarios
3. Begin writing technical documentation for developers
4. Start implementing stress tests for high player counts and complex mods
5. Complete removal of SDL2-dependent netcode files
6. Finalize compatibility mode implementation in NetworkManager
7. Implement all packet types from the original code
8. Enhance connection state management
9. Improve client-side prediction and server reconciliation
10. Implement comprehensive game settings synchronization
11. Develop robust player name handling system
12. Implement clock synchronization between client and server

## Additional Considerations

1. Ensure backward compatibility with existing GZDoom network protocol
2. Implement fallback mechanisms for clients with older versions
3. Optimize network performance for various connection types
4. Implement security measures to prevent cheating and exploitation
5. Develop tools for network debugging and performance analysis

## Enhanced Networking Features

1. Implement robust tic-based synchronization system
2. Develop advanced packet sequencing and acknowledgment system
3. Create a dedicated server mode
4. Implement a more comprehensive player management system
5. Enhance error handling and logging for network operations
6. Develop a console message system for server-client communication
7. Implement a more detailed game launch and start sequence
8. Create an advanced resend request system for missed packets
9. Enhance network diagnostics with more detailed statistics
10. Implement a more robust compatibility mode for version differences

## Optimization and Refinement

1. Implement bandwidth estimation and throttling
2. Add support for adaptive update rates
3. Optimize message packaging and compression
4. Improve accuracy of client-side prediction
5. Enhance server reconciliation to handle complex game states
6. Implement smoothing techniques for correction of prediction errors

## Documentation and Final Testing

1. Write technical documentation for developers
2. Create user guide for server operators
3. Develop documentation for mod creators
4. Document dedicated server setup and management
5. Perform extensive playtesting in various network conditions
6. Conduct stress tests with high player counts and complex mods
7. Test dedicated server functionality
8. Address and fix any identified issues or bugs

## Immediate Tasks

1. Implement integration tests for client-server communication
2. Develop system tests for full gameplay scenarios
3. Begin writing technical documentation for developers
4. Start implementing stress tests for high player counts and complex mods
5. Complete removal of SDL2-dependent netcode files
6. Finalize compatibility mode implementation in NetworkManager
